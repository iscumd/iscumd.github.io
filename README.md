# ISC website

The Intelligent Systems Club of the University of Michigan-Dearborn strives to foster a welcoming environment where passionate individuals can gain industry-applicable experience in robotics. Whether you're an experienced tinkerer or have never held a screwdriver, our club is committed to education and learning at all levels.

Our current projects are:

TinyKart

Our entry-level project for incoming members, Tinykart is an autonomous RC car platform developed by ISC for educational purposes.
Team members will learn several areas of robotics including software, mechanical, and electrical. They'll also gain experience in C++, LiDAR, Ackermann kinematic models, and a basic autonomy stack. TinyKart allows individuals to learn and experiment on a safe and inexpensive platform before moving on to our more advanced projects. 

Phoenix

Our flagship project, Phoenix, will have experienced ISC members collaborate with industry and academia alike to produce an autonomous go-kart. Competing in the Autonomous	Karting Series at Purdue University, Phoenix utilizes ROS2 and mobile robotics techniques to navigate itself at speed, all while a separate safety system keeps watch in case anything goes wrong. Phoenix will host advanced work from all of mechanical, electrical, and software engineering, providing a chance for collaboration between disciplines not commonly seen in the classroom but in industry.

Say hello to Stellar, a slick little one-pager with a super vibrant color palette (which
I guess you can always tone down if it's a little too vibrant for you), a "sticky" in-page
nav bar (powered by my Scrollex plugin), a separate generic page template (just in case
you need one), and an assortment of pre-styled elements.
